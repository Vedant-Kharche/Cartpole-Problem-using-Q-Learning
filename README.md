# Cartpole-Problem-using-Q-Learning
This project implements Q-learning to solve the CartPole-v1 control problem from OpenAI Gymnasium. The goal is to balance a pole on a moving cart by applying forces to the left or right. The state space is continuous, so we discretize it using bins to make it suitable for tabular Q-learning.
